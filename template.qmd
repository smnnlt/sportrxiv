  Place your abstract here. Use Markdown to style the abstract, e.g. write `*word*` to print a *word* in italics. You can use the Latex command `\newline\` to create a linebreak in the abstract. \newline\ *Explanation*: The second backslash ensures that styling can be applied directly after the linebreak.

# Introduction

This is a template for submissions to the [SportRxiv](https://sportrxiv.org/index.php/server) pre-print server. It uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to generate a PDF file in the desired style.

To get this template set up on your device, follow the instructions on [GitHub](https://github.com/smnnlt/sportrxiv/).

Once everything is in place, you can start by editing the .qmd file. First, replace the `articletitle`, `author` and `affiliation` info in the YAML header at the top of the document. Render the document in an appropriate GUI (e.g. R Studio, Jupyter Lab, VS Studio) or via the command line to see the resulting PDF file. Then modify the `abstract`, `keywords` and optionally other variables of the YAML header.

To write the main text of your article you can use [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). You can use *italics*, [links](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Link), or

# Methods

## Citations and References

Use the `bibliography.bib` file as your reference library. You can cite references in the text [@allaire2022]. The easiest way to streamline this process, is by using the Visual Editor for Quarto in R Studio in combination with Zotero. This allows you to insert citations from your Zotero data base, while simultaneously updating your .bib file.

## Figures and Tables

You can include Figures and Tables via the Markdown syntax. A different approach is to include/generate these via code chunks.

## Code Chunks

You can insert Quarto code chunk to render arbitrary code (e.g. R, Python, Julia, ...). By default, only the output of code-chunks is displayed, but you can override this with the local code-chunk options.

## Math

You can display math using LaTex either inline $x = \sigma²$ or in blocks:

$$
f(x) = {{1}\over{\sigma}\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-{1\over{2}}({x-\mu\over{\sigma}})^2}
$$ {#eq-norm}

Insert an equation label at the end of the equation to create the equation number on the right side.

## Cross References

You can create cross references to images, tables and equations. You first need to insert an reference label (e.g.{#eq-norm}) next to the part you want to reference to. Then you can link to it in your Markdown text, for example @eq-norm.

# Results

You may change the general structure of the document by creating new or modifying existing (sub)headings.
